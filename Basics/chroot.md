# 🧱 Chroot Environment Setup (Using debootstrap)

This document explains how to create a minimal Linux environment using `chroot` and `debootstrap`. This is part of **Task 1: Container & Runtime Basics** from the Formcept DevOps Onboarding series.

## 🔧 What is `chroot`?

**chroot** means “change root”.  
It’s a Linux/Unix command that creates a *fake environment* for a program by changing its idea of what the `/` (root folder) is.

> **In simple words**:  
> It tricks a process into thinking a subfolder is the entire root of the filesystem.  

---

## 🔍 Imagine This

Normally, a process sees:

```

/bin/bash
/etc/passwd
/var/log/syslog

```

But with `chroot`, you tell it:

> *"Hey process, your new / is /home/lavanya/newroot"*

So if inside chroot the process tries to access `/bin/bash`, it’s actually:

```

/home/lavanya/newroot/bin/bash

````

The process **thinks** it is in a full system, but it is locked in a folder.

## 🗓️ Where Did It Come From?

- Introduced in 1982 in BSD UNIX  
- Created by Bill Joy (who also co-created the `vi` editor)  
- Purpose: allow developers to test new software or Linux installs safely

## 🧠 Why Is It Useful?

| Use Case         | Meaning in Simple Terms                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Testing safely   | Install/test software in a fake system           |
| System repair    | Boot rescue mode and chroot into a broken system |
| Building packages| Build inside a clean environment                 |
| FTP/Web Jail     | Limit user access to one directory for safety    |

---

## ⚠️ Is `chroot` Secure?

**Not fully**:
- It does *not* isolate memory, users, or networks
- Hackers with root can easily escape a chroot jail

👉 That’s why modern containers like Docker exist — they fix what chroot cannot.

| Feature       | Description                                           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| What it does  | Changes the root directory (`/`) for a program        |
| Good for      | Sandboxing, testing, repairs                          |
| Not good for  | Real security                                         |
| Invented      | 1982 (BSD UNIX)                                       |
| Used by       | Developers, sysadmins, package builders               |

## ⚙️ Objective

Set up a basic isolated shell environment using:
- Core binaries like `bash`, `ls`
- Required shared libraries
- A minimal root filesystem with `debootstrap`



## 📦 Prerequisites

- A Linux environment (or WSL on Windows)
- `sudo` privileges
- Tools: `debootstrap`, `chroot`, `ldd`

## 🧪 Method 1: Manual chroot (Optional but Good to Know)

> Skip to [Method 2](#-method-2-debootstrap-way-recommended-easy) if you only want debootstrap.

### 🔨 Steps:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/jail/{bin,lib,lib64}
sudo cp /bin/bash ~/jail/bin/
ldd /bin/bash
# Copy required .so files to ~/jail/lib and ~/jail/lib64

# Optionally add ls
sudo cp /bin/ls ~/jail/bin/
ldd /bin/ls
# Copy required .so files

sudo chroot ~/jail /bin/bash
````

Inside, fix your path:

```bash
export PATH=/bin
```

✅ Now you are in a minimal fake root.





## 🚀 Method 2: debootstrap Way (Recommended–Easy)

### ✅ Step 1: Install debootstrap

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install debootstrap
```

### ✅ Step 2: Bootstrap a minimal Debian system

```bash
sudo debootstrap stable ~/mychroot http://deb.debian.org/debian/
```

This creates a working root filesystem in `~/mychroot`.

### ✅ Step 3: Enter the chroot

```bash
sudo chroot ~/mychroot /bin/bash
```

Now you are inside a **minimal Debian OS**!

## 🧹 Exiting and Cleaning Up

To exit:

```bash
exit
```

To delete the chroot folder:

```bash
sudo rm -rf ~/mychroot
```

## 🔑 What is `sudo`?

**sudo** stands for *“superuser do”*.
It lets a normal user temporarily run commands as the root user (administrator).

### 💡 Why?

Linux does not allow normal users to:

* Install software
* Change protected system files
* Create privileged folders like `/fake_root`

### 💬 For this chroot task, `sudo` is needed because:

* You are creating a new root filesystem
* You are downloading and installing system files
* You are using the `chroot` command itself (requires root)

---

### 🛡️ Why Not Always Be Root?

* Running everything as root is dangerous:

  * One wrong command can break your system
  * Malware can cause serious damage

Using `sudo` ensures:

* You think before doing risky stuff
* Only specific commands run with elevated privileges

> **`sudo` is a temporary admin key — used only when absolutely needed.**

## 🧠 Why Is chroot Still Relevant?

* Shows how container-like isolation worked before Docker
* Helps understand container runtimes (runc, containerd, Docker)
* Builds low-level Linux confidence


Let me know if you'd like a `.gitignore`, folder structure setup, or help with `git init`, `commit`, and `push`.
